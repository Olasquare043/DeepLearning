    "# Building a Simple Neural Network\n",
    "Welcome to the first lab of this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll build and train your first neural network, a single neuron that learns patterns from data to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with the delivery scenario from the lecture videos: You're a bike delivery person with a 7-mile delivery order. Your company promises delivery in under 30 minutes, and one more late delivery could put your job at risk. Can you make this delivery on time? Your neural network will learn from historical delivery data to help you decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline from the lecture videos, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare delivery data, the distances and times from past orders.\n",
    "Build a simple neural network using PyTorch (just one neuron!).\n",
    "Train it to find the relationship between distance and delivery time.\n",
    "Predict whether you can make that 7-mile delivery in time."
